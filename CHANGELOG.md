# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog][keepachangelog], and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning][semver].

## Unreleased
- changed: Enable `AUTOINCREMENT` for `serial` and `bigserial`. [#98](https://github.com/elixir-sqlite/ecto_qlite3/pull/98)
- **breaking**: Add support for sqlite strict mode. [#97](https://github.com/elixir-sqlite/ecto_sqlite3/pull/97)

With sqlite strict mode support being added, the following field "types" were altered.

* `TEXT_DATETIME` => `TEXT`
* `TEXT_UUID` => `TEXT`: This is when `:binary_id_type` is `:string`
* `UUID` => `BLOB`: This is when `:binary_id_type` is `:binary`

This is a breaking change in the sense that rebuilding the schema from scratch will cause those columns to show up differently. Under the hood sqlite does not actually care.

We kept `TEXT_DATETIME` to satisfy the old Ecto2 implementation to keep backwards compatibility.

- **breaking**: raise when table prefixes are used. [#103](https://github.com/elixir-sqlite/ecto_sqlite3/pull/103)
